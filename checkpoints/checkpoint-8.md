# Checkpoint 8

Final checkpoint! You've made it to the last one! Congratulations.

Here, we want to "orchestrate" the Mole logic (when the moles pop in or out) and plug it into our app to make it a real Whackamole game.

At a high level, we want to:

* [ ] Write a function, that when invoked, picks a random mole, and “pops it up”.
  * [ ] [Math.random()](https://developer.mozilla.org/ja/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random) will come in handy.
* [ ] Use [setInterval](https://developer.mozilla.org/ja/docs/Web/API/Window/setInterval) to repeatedly run the mole logic when a game is started.
* [ ] When a game finishes, [clear the setInterval](https://developer.mozilla.org/ja/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/clearInterval).

Good luck! You can checkout the `solution` branch for the full solution! Congrats, you've made it to the end!
