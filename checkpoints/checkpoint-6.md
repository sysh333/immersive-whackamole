# Checkpoint 6

For this checkpoint, you will inherit some sample code that another front-end engineer has put together for your _Mole_ component.

You will have one task using a VueJS component property that you haven't used yet:

* [ ] Open the Chrome console, go into the DOM and see what happens when you add/remove the ‘active’ or ‘inactive’ class to the `<div class="mole-container">`.
* [ ] In the Mole component, Add an “active” class based on whether the `active` prop is true or false. (The goal here is to change the class name based on a `prop` that is passed down)
  * [ ] Look up [v-bind:class on VueJS docs](https://jp.vuejs.org/v2/guide/class-and-style.html)
  * [ ] Look up [computed properties on VueJS docs](https://jp.vuejs.org/v2/guide/computed.html)
